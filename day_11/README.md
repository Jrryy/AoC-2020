# Day 11
Oof what a mess I've made. I'm not very good at JavaScript and it shows. I've messed up a few times not copying my arrays but rather copying the reference and I was wondering why my solutions didn't work. Not a very difficult problem really but once again using a language I'm not proficient with doesn't help at all.
