# Day 2
Today was Rust's time.

Now this is a language I had absolutely never used, but I was always kinda interested in why it has such big and passionate fans, so I added it to my list of possible languages.
So far, I haven't really enjoyed using it. Maybe its learning curve is very pronounced at the beginning, maybe its safety didn't let me do things I've always taken for granted in other languages...
Still, it was my duty to get my hands dirty and solve this problem using it.

It was an easy problem, doable even with a python one liner, so it doesn't really deserve an explanation. In fact, it's me who needs an explanation to what I've done: why does my main function need to return a io::Result? Why couldn't I open the file without the `?`? Why do I have to `unwrap` everything? What does that `Ok(())` do? Guess I'll look into that later.
