# Day 5
Time to touch swift, a language that I'll most probably never in my life use again. 
To be honest, it has been a pleasant surprise, it's kinda easy to use, knowing its purpose. I really wouldn't mind using it again. It's sort of like python with apple steroids (and mandatory typing, cool!).

## Part 1
Just move those bits to the left dude.

## Part 2
I sorted and looked for a number the next one of which in the array of ids wasn't the immediately next integer. It's expensive, I know, I tried using the arrays' `contains` method but it didn't seem to work? Idk why. Anyways it's saturday I couldn't spend all day long fixing a bug that I could just ignore.
