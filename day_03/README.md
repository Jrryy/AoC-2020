# Day 3
Thanks to the RNG god, I got Go which I like quite a lot.

Today's challenge was also pretty easy, just read through the lines of the input and count how many runes in the `(line*3)%31`th positions are `#`. Because of part 2 being pretty much the same but changing the amount of positions to the right and skipping one line each, I defined a function to do that count, and that's all.
