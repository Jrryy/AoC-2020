# Day 12
I finally got python! It took me 12 days to get my main language. To be honest I'm happy because I've had the chance to lear a lot of stuff using all the others, but I needed to take a rest and do something the easy way.

The problem is as easy as it can get, not much to talk about, just follow the instructions.
