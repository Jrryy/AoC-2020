# Day 13
JavaScript again. Starting to get sick of it, and for a reason this time.

## Part 1
Very easy, not much to explain, just play a little with the modules.

## Part 2
It was clear that this challenge was all about modules, and it looked like what I needed was to use them, but I couldn't quite think of the chinese reminder theorem, I had forgotten about it. Thus, I have not much to explain here, I found out that people were using the theorem on reddit and I coded the algorithm, with an extra difficulty caused by JavaScript's terrible handling of big numbers. Not proud of this one, but at least I've done it.
