# Day 9
First and last problem I solve with assembly. It took me 2 whole days to find what I was doing wrong. I felt nothing but joy and happiness when I finally had it done, but sometimes I felt like I was about to lose my mind. I didn't even bother parsing the input with assembly - the initialization of the problem was made in C++.

The problem was actually very easy, solvable in seconds using a language of much higher level, but having to write the code instruction by instruction really requires a very big change in your way of coding. Yes I ended up with an extremely fast code that ran in 4ms, but at what cost. As I said, 2 days of debugging with ddd were not worth having it in the randomizer for the rest of the advent of code.
