# Day 6
Today's language was Kotlin. I already was a little familiar with it since I had developed a very basic Android app with it a while ago. What I didn't know, though, is that it could be used for scripting too. That's really cool. It still needs to be compiled every time you run your code though, so it takes a while to execute, but I think it's pretty nice that you can just start coding and forget about main functions and stuff.

The challenge was very easy, the best idea was to use sets to easily perform unions and intersections and that was pretty much it.
