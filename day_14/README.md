# Day 14
So today I got Rust, but after hours of debugging a code I couldn't really understand I gave up and used Go. I guess I tried to learn too fast a language you're supposed to spend hours with just to get started.

## Part 1
The problem itself wasn't hard at all, you just have to format the numbers as bits and then select bit by bit a 1 or a 0 depending on what appears in the mask. It took me long because of what I said, using a language I don't understand at all that offers no flexibility whatsoever.

## Part 2
I used recursion to build the addresses bit by bit. I could have made this part's time more efficient easily by using dynamic programming and not rerunning the same method with the exact same outcome, but I was tired.
